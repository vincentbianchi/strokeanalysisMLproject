## Stroke Risk Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and models for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on publicly available stroke data. The goal is to identify factors that contribute to the risk of stroke and provide a tool for highlighting patients who are at a higher risk.

## Models
The project includes four machine learning models:

Lasso Regression Model
Logistic Regression Model
XGBoost Model
Random Forest Model

Each model is designed to analyze and predict the likelihood of stroke based on input features.
